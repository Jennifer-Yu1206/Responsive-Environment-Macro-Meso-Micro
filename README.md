# Responsive-Environment-Macro-Meso-Micro

The project is an exploration of the connection among three different scales of space, including the meso space where we inhabit and occupy, the wide macro space, and the micro space that is invisible to us. There are 4 3D scenes, including a universe scene, a nature scene, a 3D scan of the exhibition room, and a scene representing the human microenvironment. The camera travels from outer space into the body of people in the exhibition room. The experience tries to invoke thoughts about our existence in relation to environments on different scales. By conducting all the elements in our project with colorful and various particles, we also demonstrate the idea that matters in different scales differ in appearance but at the same time have a consistent essence.

The physical interface is built with an Arduino and IMU sensor. It allows users to view the scenes 360 degrees by rotating the sphere.
